# Issue with my code? PR it.
I have had some come to me accusing me of not understanding strings because of the append on L32. 

I could have done `str(pixel[blue]).join(binary_string)` or even converting the variable into a list and `.append`ing everything then converting into a string at the return.
However I wrote this late at night and I do not care as it does do what it is needed too. 

I have never seen people get triggered over an operator before.
